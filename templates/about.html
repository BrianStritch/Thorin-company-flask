<h2>About Page </h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
    in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
    when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the
    Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
    force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from
    rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had
    planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath
            the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
            found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
            in death.[2]

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's
            company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly
            Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of
            Thorin's companions, who were most often named only in "group" references to the entire company.

            Óin
        </h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
            Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
            in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and
            Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
            who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
            were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the
            others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
            with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            Gloin
        </h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin
            and younger brother of Óin.

            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of
            the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

            In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
            March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin
            to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin
            referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling
            distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            Balin
        </h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger
            brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely
            Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA
            2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely
            Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

        <p>
            Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
            younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin
            accompanied Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

            Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left
            the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In
            TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood
            from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin
            to inform him the news.

            remote kinsmen of Thorin II Oakenshield.

            Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori
            became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other
            Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the
            other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived.

        <p>
            Dori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk, who, along with his brother Nori and cousin Ori,[1] travelled with
            Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield as a member of Thorin's Company on the Quest for Erebor, to reclaim
            the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the
            forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his
            grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be
            the strongest of the thirteen companions.

            Before the Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and
            Ori. In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling
            with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

        <p>
            Nori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk. He had a brother named Dori as well as a cousin named Ori,[1] and was
            a remote kinsman of Thorin Oakenshield. His hood was purple, he played the flute, and he was very fond
            of regular and plentiful meals like his Hobbit friend, Bilbo Baggins.

            Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with
            them. Both shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived
            in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

            In TA 2941, Nori, along with Dori and Ori, became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins
            and traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure in the Lonely Mountain. After their experience in
            Goblin-town when the company was pursued by Wargs and Orcs and forced to climb up into some trees, Nori
            was the first realize that Bilbo had been left on the ground and pointed him out to his brother Dori who
            rescued Bilbo.

        <h3>
            Bifur
        </h3>
        <p>
            Bifur was a Dwarf of the late-Third Age. He is best known for being a companion to Bilbo Baggins and
            Thorin Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain, along with his cousins Bofur and Bombur.

            Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not related to the royal House of
            Durin. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He
            and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced
            to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a
            new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

            Answering Thorin Oakenshield's Quest of Erebor, he went to the meeting at Bag End with his cousins Bofur
            and Bombur, where he played the clarinet. On the quest, he was nearly cooked on a spit by Trolls and
            nearly killed by Goblins, Wargs, Stone giants, Great Spiders, and the dragon Smaug himself. A valiant
            and brave warrior, Bifur never gave up, and fought in the Battle of Five Armies with all his strength,
            killing numerous enemies. In the fallout of the great battle, Dáin II Ironfoot gave him his share of the
            treasure, and he retired to live at the Lonely Mountain.[1]

        <p>
            Bofur was a Dwarf of the late-Third Age. He is best known as a companion of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin
            Oakenshield, and Gandalf on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, along with
            his brother Bombur and cousin Bifur.

            Bofur was not related to the royal House of Durin but was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm.


            While answering Thorin Oakenshield's quest to Erebor, Bofur went to the meeting at Bag End with his
            brother Bombur and cousin Bifur. He accompanied Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and rest of Thorin's
            Company across Wilderland to the Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim the Dwarves' treasure from the
            dragon Smaug. Following the dragon's demise, Bofur participated in and survived the Battle of Five
            Armies, receiving his fourteenth share of the treasure as agreed upon.[1]


            Little is known about his life after the Battle of Five Armies. Glóin reported to Frodo Baggins just
            before the Council of Elrond that Bofur was alive and prospering in Erebor. He may have lived into the
            early Fourth Age, but his time of death is untold.

        <p>
            Bombur was a Dwarf who accompanied Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins on their quest to the Lonely
            Mountain as part of the company, alongside his brother Bofur and cousin Bifur. Bombur was noted as the
            fattest Dwarf in the company.

            Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of
            Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown,
            though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of
            the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli
            was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the
            quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the
            loss of Thráin II.

            Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The
            Lord of the Rings.

            Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of
            Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring,
            and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a
            book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his
            heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.

            Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and one of the few to set foot in the
            Undying Lands.

            Gandalf in Tengwar
            "He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy
            eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat."
            —The Fellowship of the Ring, "A Long-expected Party"

            Gandalf the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin]),
            was an Istar (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined
            Thorin II Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship
            of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.

            Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception of
            Melian). He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time
            amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda,
            Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda[3], yet his ways often took him to
            Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore
            the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he
            followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those
            who listened to him out of despair.[3]
